# EDM-Portfolio - Munoz J.
Welcome to my portfolio! This repository showcases my work on various Enterprise Data Management (EDM) lab tasks.
These projects reflect my understanding and hands-on experience with data management principles.
## About Me
Hi there! I'm Justine Muñoz, an 18-year-old aspiring IT professional from Angeles City, Pampanga. Currently, I’m pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information Systems at the City College of Angeles. 
I'm passionate about data management, system analysis, and finding efficient ways to manage and utilize data in real-world applications. Feel free to explore my work and connect with me!
When I'm not immersed in tech, I love listening to R&B and pop songs, especially from SZA and Ariana Grande. Their music is my therapy, helping me unwind and stay motivated. Feel free to explore my work and connect with me!
