# EDM-Portfolio - Munoz J.
Welcome to my portfolio! This repository showcases my work on various Enterprise Data Management (EDM) lab tasks.
These projects reflect my understanding and hands-on experience with data management principles.

When I'm not immersed in tech, I love listening to R&B and pop songs, especially from SZA and Ariana Grande. Their music is my therapy, helping me unwind and stay motivated. Feel free to explore my work and connect with me!
