# Midterm Lab Task 1 - Data Cleaning and Preparation using ECXEL
This project focuses on data cleaning and preparation techniques using Excel. The task involves working with raw data to ensure it is accurate, complete, and formatted for analysis.
## Step 1 - Data Cleaning Process
- Load the raw file
- Fit Column and row width and height
- TRIM extra spaces
- Remove NULL values
- Remove Duplication
## Step 2 - Normalization
- Implemented First Normal Form (1NF) by ensuring all data is atomic.
- Applied Second Normal Form (2NF) to eliminate partial dependencies.
- Carried out Third Normal Form (3NF) by removing transitive dependencies.
- Mapped the normalized tables into a physical data model for implementation.
